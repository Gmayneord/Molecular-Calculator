# Molecular-Calculator
This app is intended to be a useful tool for the lab / planning experiments. 
The app allows you to store reagents and their molecular weights, and use them in some basic lab calculations for solutions. 
When first opening the app, a .json file will be created in the same directory, in which the reagents will be stored. Be sure to run the script / compiled app from somewhere you don't mind this json file existing, and more importantly you won't accidentally delete!
